## Advanced

For more fun and learning you can implement this first with both a full
encription and decription method utilizing the mathematical functions
introduced above.

Then as a second implementation, focusing on speed and readability, you
can simply make an encrypted copy of the alphabet and translate between
the pair to bypass implementation of the decription function:

- `D(y) = a^-1(u - b) mod m`
